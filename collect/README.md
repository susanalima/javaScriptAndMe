## SETUP

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


3. Give permissions to scripts.

    In collect folder:

    `cd scripts`

    `chmod +x init.sh`

    `chmod +x clean.sh`

    In github, npm and web folders:

    `chmod +x build.sh`

    `chmod +x run.h`

4. Run init script to create required directory structure (`sudo` required).

    `sudo ./scripts/init.sh`
  

5. change docker path name in run script
