## SETUP

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


3. Give permissions to scripts.

    `cd scripts`

    `chmod +x init.sh`

    `chmod +x cleans.h`

    In github, npm and web folders:

     `chmod +x build.sh`

    `chmod +x run.h`

4. Run init script to create required directory structure (`sudo` required).

    `sudo ./scripts/init.sh`
  

5. change docker path name in run script

## BUILD and RUN

### GITHUB

`cd ./github`

build: 

`./build.sh`

run: 

`./run.sh <collect_option> <number_repos> <source>`

* collect_option: 
    * "code": for collecting the javascript from the websites
    * "sources": for collecting urls from GitHub's REST API
* number_repos: number of repositories to clone / collect
* source:
    * "extensions": collect list of browser extensions
    * "vanilla": collect list of repositories written in vanilla javascript

or

`./run.sh`

by default `<collect_option` is "code", `<number_repos` is 1.000 and `<source` is "extensions".


### NPM

`cd ./npm`

build: 

`./build.sh`

run: 

`./run.sh <collect_option> <number_modules>`

* collect_option: 
    * "code": for collecting the javascript from the websites
    * "sources": for collecting urls from [here](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md). 
* number_modules: number of sites to download / collect

or

`./run.sh`

by default `<collect_option` is "code" and `<number_modules` is 1.000.


### WEB

`cd ./web`

build: 
`./build.sh`

run: 

`./run.sh <collect_option> <number_urls><start_at>`

* collect_option: 
    * "code": for collecting the javascript from the websites
    * "sources": for collecting urls from the [Majestic Million service](https://de.majestic.com/reports/majestic-million?)
* number_urls: number of sites to visit / collect
* start_at: position of the urlsToVisit.txt list (./input/) to start visiting the urls.
